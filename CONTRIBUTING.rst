Contributing to the Pentatonics Matrix CLI
==========================================

As an open source project, I welcome contributions
from others who are interested in expanding this project.

Examples of contributions include:

- Helping to finish the chord/scale matrix

- Adding new pentatonic scales

- Bug reports


**Please Note:** I reserve the right to reject arbitrary scales.
I want to keep this CLI clean and useful for the majority of
players. The intent is not to include every possible permutation
of pentatonic scales.

Pull Request Process

If adding scales to the matrix, please ensure the following:

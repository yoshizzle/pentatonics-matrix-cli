Pentatonics Matrix Command Line Interface
=========================================

.. highlight: python

A Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for choosing
which pentatonic scales to play over chords.

Motivation
----------

I am a lifelong musician and had always struggled to find an 
effective system for learning which pentatonic scales to play
over various chords. After leaning on the 
knowledge of jazz heavyweights such as Allan Holdsworth, 
Jerry Bergonzi, Scott McGill, McCoy Tyner, and many others,
I came up with the idea of a matrix.

Of course, music is subjective, so your mileage may vary as to
what scales sound good over different chords. This is intended
to be a general guide and by no means an official rulebook for
playing music. Ultimately, my goal is to help other musicians
find new and exciting ways to express themselves. I hope you 
enjoy this project as much as I have in creating it.
